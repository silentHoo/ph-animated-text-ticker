ph-animated-text-ticker
================

This component  gives you the ability to let text slide in an environment where the text hasn't enough
space to be fully shown. You may know that behaviour from some hardware devices like car radios or MP3 players.
When the text hasn't enough space he'll slide with a smooth ease function from right to left in respect to the ratio
between the length of the text string to show and the animation duration. That means the text will slide slower, if
the space is small and the text long.

You can style the text like you want as of every web component you know. Please use the pseudo selectors `::shadow` and
`/deep/` as you prefer. I'll not change any `HTMLElement id` or `class name` within the components `<template>` in the
next minor versions so you can be sure that your component will not break in the upcoming minor versions.

There's also a built-in resize event handler which handles the animations if the user resizes the browser. If there's
enough space available and the user can see all the messages no animation will start, otherwise an animation will be
started.
